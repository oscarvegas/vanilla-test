# Task Description Email

We would very much like to see a demonstration of your ability 
to develop a PHP solution. 

In this case, we'd like to see a simple site with a basic login 
that requires integration with a third-party platform. The basic acceptance criteria is as follows:

 * Users will sign-in using their GitHub account.
 * Once signed-in, users will be presented with a list of their 
   GitHub repositories, grouped by owner. 
 * Repositories should be cached with a lifetime of twenty-four hours.
 * Only the first â€œpage" of repositories returned from the API is 
 	necessary (i.e. no pagination).
 * All backend code must be written in PHP.
 * Only nginx, PHP and MySQL should be considered as available services.

Within these parameters, you're welcome to use whatever 
technologies and strategies you'd like. 

Once completed, please archive your solution and email it back to us.

Additional notes:

 - Feel free to use whatever framework you're comfortable with.
 - You may use Composer packages.
 - GitHub has some great documentation. You might find the following to be helpful:

Please let me know if you have any questions.
